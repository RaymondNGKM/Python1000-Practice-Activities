# Python1000-Practice-Activities
This free & open project contains additional activities for intermediate Python students, or students who have completed our "Python 1000" Training SERIES. 

***If you like these type of real-world practice activities, please buy the [Python by Design Book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HJBD98J), and I'll make more. (The book also has my code, as crafted for each activity.)***

If you've no experience with programming, here is our primer - it is "mostly free:" https://www.udemy.com/python-1000

If you have no experience with Python 3 but know how to program, then jump right in @: https://www.udemy.com/python-1100

You may also enjoy our [question & answer database](https://github.com/Python3-Training/DatMan/tree/master/QuestJSOB) efforts? 

# Overview
This project has been designed for software developers who are interested in creating software from professionally defined use cases using the most common set of UML diagrams. Pythoneers enrolled in other Python training opportunities will also enjoy these activities.

If you are wondering what software design is all about, consider viewing:

THE AMAZON BOOK
--------
Recently combined together with the ***official source code*** as well as ***3 bonus exercies*** & no-nonsence career advice, our "Python by Design" is available on Amazon. In addition to the official code and bonus exercises, **Python by Design** also shares a few of the project insights that I use to help me succeed in our modern, profe$$ional software developer world.

The Kindle Edition
-----
Better still, if you are part of Amazon's "Kindle Club" (kindle unlimited) then you & yours might be able to get the book for free. On-line or in paperback, the source code solution to all projects will always be included in the book.

Amazon Opportunity: [Python by Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HJBD98J)

IN THE BOOK: For any who need a little help or a peek at the code I came up with, the source code is included in the book. Like most books a link to the official support site (eratta, official solutons, etc,) as well as my industry insights / advice, will also be found in that Amazon tome, as well.
